jQuerySavantUI
==============

A jQuery plugin that generates multi-dimensional data visualization widgets in SVG.

Some of these widgets were inspired by some clever visualization techniques implemented in an Oracle RDBMS monitoring tool 
called [Q Diagnostic Center for Oracle][1] from a company called Savant Corp (which was sadly discontinued). 

Here's an example of a widget from the Savant documentation that displays Oracle cache statistics:

 * [jQuerySVG][3]: For creating and manipulating SVG
 * [jQueryUI][4]: For providing tooltips, draggable and resizable.
